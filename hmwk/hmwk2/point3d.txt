Q1:

(1.) Point3d& operator+(Point3d& lhs, Point3d& rhs);

(2.) 
3, 6, 5
3, 6, 5
3, 6, 5

(There might be a memory leak as the p3 pointer was never freed from the heap)
 

Q2:

const bag& operator=(const bag& rhs){
	if (this == &rhs) return *this;
	used = rhs.size();
	for (int i = 0; i < used; i++){
		this->data[i] = rhs.data[i];
	}
	return *this;
}

bag(const bag& b){
	used = rhs.used;
	for (int i = 0; i < used; i++){
		data[i] = rhs.data[i];
	}	
}
